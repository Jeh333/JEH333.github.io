<h2 id="-music-"><em>Music</em></h2>
<p>Music has always been something that I have found both comforting to listen to and to make. I create music in a DAW named Ableton. I Dj using my turntable and Serato program. I know how to play the guitar, piano, saxophone, and am a decent singer. I love going to festivals and concerts. My first festival was Bonnaroo in 2017, and it created a passionate love. My favorite genres are rock, metal, and EDM. I have a soundcloud page that hasn&#39;t been updated in a while. I tend to share my music less and keep it for personal use. But there are some old unrefined tracks that are terrible, but fun to listen to for me.</p>
